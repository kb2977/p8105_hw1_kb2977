#Problem 1

Below is a random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution.

```{r random_sample, echo=FALSE}

rand_samp <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
rand_samp
```

rand_samp

A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
A (length-10) character vector
A (length-10) factor vector
Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesnâ€™t? Why?

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the output). What happens? In a second code chunk, convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric; similarly, convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric. What happens?



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
