#Problem 1

Below is a random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution.

```{r random_sample, echo=FALSE}

rand_samp <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
rand_samp
```

Below is a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2.

```{r logical_vec, echo=FALSE}

log_vec <- c(rand_samp)
new_log_vec <- c(log_vec > 2)
new_log_vec
```

Below is a (length-10) character vector.
```{r char_vec, echo=FALSE}

char_vec <- c(LETTERS[1:10])
char_vec
```

Below is a (length-10) factor vector.

```{r fac_vec, echo=FALSE}

fac_vec <- factor(c(LETTERS[1:10]))
fac_vec
```

Below is a dataframe containin all four vectors.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

df=data.frame(rand_samp,new_log_vec, char_vec, fac_vec)
df
```

Below is the mean of each variable in my dataframe.

```{r}

mean(rand_samp)
mean(new_log_vec)
mean(char_vec)
mean(fac_vec)
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesnâ€™t? Why?

In some cases, you can explicitly convert variables from one type to another. Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not the output). What happens? In a second code chunk, convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric; similarly, convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric. What happens?

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
